# Microcontroller Programming
This project concerns the ATMega4808 microcontroller programming for creating certain apps.

In order to run the C files and see the changes in the registers of ATMega4808 you will have to use a simulator. I used the Microchip Studio simulator which supports many AVR and SAM devices. Also in project files the Datasheet of ATMega4808 is contained.

The apps that are implemented with ATMega4808 are the following ones:
- traffic_lights.c:
- smart_home_device.c: 
- fan_movement_control.c: 
- smart_greenhouse_simulation.c:
